\section{Mathematics of Optimization}

\subsection{Unconstrained Optimization}

\begin{itemize}
    \item First order conditions: $\frac{\delta f}{\delta x} = 0, \frac{\delta f}{\delta y} = 0$
    \item Second order conditions: $\frac{\delta^{2} f}{\delta x^{2}} < 0, \frac{\delta^{2} f}{\delta y^{2}} < 0$
    \item Additionally, $(\frac{\delta^{2} f}{\delta x^{2}} \times \frac{\delta^{2} f}{\delta y^{2}}) - (\frac{\delta^{2} f}{\delta x \delta y})^{2} > 0$
\end{itemize}

Example: $G(T,C) = 50 + 10T + 16C - T^{2} - 2TC - 2C^{2}$

$\frac{\delta G}{\delta T} = 10 - 2T - 2C$

$\frac{\delta G}{\delta C} = 16 - 2T - 4C$

$\begin{bmatrix}
    -2 & -2 & -10 \\
    -2 & -4 & -16
\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}
    -2 & -2 & -10 \\
    0 & -2 & -6
\end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}
    -2 & 0 & -4 \\
    0 & -2 & -6
\end{bmatrix}$

$\Rightarrow T = 2, C = 3$

$\frac{\delta^{2} G}{\delta T^{2}} = -2 < 0$

$\frac{\delta^{2} G}{\delta C^{2}} = -4 < 0$

$(\frac{\delta^{2}G}{\delta T^{2}} \times \frac{\delta^{2} G}{\delta C^{2}}) - (\frac{\delta^{2}G}{\delta T \delta C})^{2} = (-2 \times -4) - (-2)^{2} = 8 - 4 = 4 > 0$

$\Rightarrow G(2, 3) \text{ is a maximum } \Rightarrow G(2,3) = 50 + 20 + 48 - 4 - 12 - 18 = 84$

\subsection{Constrained Optimization}

To find the critical points of $f(x,y)$ subject to some constraints $c - g(x,y) = 0$ we have

Lagrangian: $L = f(x,y) - \lambda(c - g(x,y))$

We take the derivative wrt x, y, and $\lambda$ to get

$\begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\delta f}{\delta x} & = \lambda\frac{\delta g}{\delta x} \\
    \frac{\delta f}{\delta y} & = \lambda\frac{\delta g}{\delta y} \\
    g(x) & = c
\end{bmatrix}$

Example: $T = 19.25 - 6\ln(R) - 4\ln(W)$, constraint is $R + W = 5$

$\begin{bmatrix}
    19.25 - \frac{6}{R} & = \lambda \\
    19.25 - \frac{4}{W} & = \lambda \\
    R + W & = 5
\end{bmatrix}$

$19.25 - \frac{6}{R} = 19.25 - \frac{4}{W} \Rightarrow 6W = 4R$

$W = 5 - R \Rightarrow 6(5 - R) = 4R \Rightarrow 30 - 6R = 4R \Rightarrow 10R = 30 \Rightarrow R = 3, W = 2$

$T(3, 2) = 19.25 - 6\ln(3) - 4\ln(2) \approx 9.89$

Example: $I = \frac{P^{2}}{250} + \frac{PA}{100} + \frac{A^{2}}{1000}$, constraint is $P + A = 110$

$\begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{P}{125} + \frac{A}{100} & = \lambda \\
    \frac{P}{100} + \frac{A}{500} & = \lambda \\
    P + A & = 110
\end{bmatrix}$

$\frac{P}{125} + \frac{A}{100} = \frac{P}{100} + \frac{A}{500}$

$\frac{P}{125} - \frac{P}{100} = \frac{-4A}{500}$

$\frac{-P}{500} = \frac{-4A}{500}$

$P = 4A \Rightarrow 5A = 110 \Rightarrow A = 22 \Rightarrow P = 88$

$I(88, 22) = 50.82$

\section{Consumer Theory}

Defining preferences:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Preferences reflect choices
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Defined over bundles of goods
        \item Based upon all properties of a bundle
    \end{itemize}
    \item Notation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Strictly Preferred $\succ$
        \item Weakly Preferred $\succeq$
        \item Indifferent $\sim$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Preferences are assumed to be well-bheaved
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Complete: An individual knows hiw or her preferences over any two bundles
        \item Reflexive: An individual must be indifferent between two identical bundles of goods
        \item Transitivity: No cycles
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Anchoring and Adjustment:

In multi-dimensional problems, people tend to anchor on one dimension and adjust for the other.

\subsection{Utility Functions}

A utility function is a function from bundles of goods into real numbers.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x \succ y \Rightarrow u(x) > u(y)$
    \item More preferred bundles must be assigned larger numbers
    \item If preferences are well-behaved, we can write down a utility function that captures the preferences
\end{itemize}

Ordinal utility function: the only thing that matters is the order

Cardinal utility function: the numbers have significance and meaning

Assumptions about utility functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monotonicity: $x > x' \Rightarrow u(x,y) \ge u(x', y)$
    \item Convexity: Let $\alpha \text{ s.t. } 0 < \alpha < 1$. If $u(x,y) = u(x',y'), u(\alpha x + (1 - \alpha)x', \alpha y + (1 - \alpha)y') \ge u(x,y)$
\end{itemize}

Indifference curve: a curve along which $u(x,y) = c$ for some constant c

Marginal Utility: the marginal utility of x ($MU_{x}$) is defined as the increase in utility from consuming one additional good of x

$MU_{x} = \frac{\delta u}{\delta x}$

The marginal rate of substitution of x, y is the amount of good y needed to make up for the loss of one of good x

$MRS_{xy} = \frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}}$

\subsection{Budget Constraints}

The budget line is the line along which the amount spent exactly equals the available budget.

Let B be the budget, and $p_{x}, p_{y}$ be the price of good $x$ or good $y$. Thus, we have the budget line as $p_{x}x + p_{y}y = B$

Solving for $y$, we see have $y = \frac{B}{p_{y}} - \frac{p_{x}}{p_{y}}x$

The slope of the budget line is $\frac{p_{x}}{p_{y}}$, which can be interpreted as the opportunity cost of good $x$ in terms of good $y$

\subsubsection{Non-linear Constraints}

Complexities
\begin{itemize}
    \item Charity with restrictions
    \item Taxes with brackets
    \item Programs with income eligibility
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conditions for Utility Maximization}

Consider an individual choosing how much they want to consume, they are choosing optimally, with a positive amount of all goods.

Then, the following must be true at their optimal consumption bundle: $MRS_{xy} = \frac{p_{x}}{p_{y}}$

GARP states that people will always have consistent preferences

If x is revealed preferred to y, then y cannot be directly revealed preferred to x.

\subsection{Incentive Systems}

Incentive systems are good (maybe?) (commissions or other incentives)

Risk-averse subjects are averse to incentives

\section{Choice Under Uncertainty}

\subsection{Stuff I haven't written down yet}

\subsection{Prospect Theory}

Kahneman and Tversky (1979)

Expected utility theory embodies strong assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perceived are equal to true probabilities
    \item Independence of gambles
    \item Preferences are over wealth (not presentation)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Probability Weighting Function}

Small probability events are over-weighted.

Lies above a 45-degree line for low values

\subsubsection{Loss Aversion}

Losses are weighted more heavily than gains

Losing x money is worse than gaining x money is good

Work harder when incentives are framed as a fine than a bonus

\section{Theory of the Firm}

We will maintain the assumption that firms are profit maximizing

This is a weird assumption, but useful

Entrepeneurs make a number of mistakes, lack of planning/marketing etc.

Non-profits are obviously not profit maximizing.

They engage in behavior opposite to the assumption we made.

Profit maximizing is simple, and clearly relevant.

\subsection{The Production Function}

The production function for a firm, y = f($\vec{x}$) gives the max. amount of output (y) that can be made from the bundle $\vec{x}$

An isoquant is a set of bundles that all give the same amount of output

Production functions have similar assumptions as utility functions, monotonicity and convexity

The technical rate of substitution is the marginal rate of substitution

Production functions are cardinal

\subsection{Profit Maximization}

Maximize $py - (w_{1}x_{1} + w_{2}x_{2})$ where $f(x_{1},x_{2}) = y$

$L = py - (w_{1}x_{1} + w_{2}x_{2}) + \lambda(f(x_{1}, x_{2}) - y)$

$c(y) = w_{1}x_{1}(y) + w_{2}x_{2}(y)$
