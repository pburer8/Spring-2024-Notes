Fault rate with memory size of 20:
FIFO: 78.7%
LRU: 77.9%
Second chance: 78.05%
En. second chance: 77.85%

Fault rate with memory size of 50:
FIFO: 48.25%
LRU: 48.10%
Second chance: 48.25%
En. second chance: 48.15%

This increase is directly proportional to the size of memory

With memory size of 20, we see about 80% page fault rate, minus some for cases where no swap is necessary
With memory size of 50, we see about 50% page fault rate, with the same cases
