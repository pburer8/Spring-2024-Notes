Fault rate with memory size of 20:
FIFO: 78.7%
LRU: 77.9%
Second chance: 78.05%
En. second chance: 77.85%

Fault rate with memory size of 100:
FIFO: 5.00%
LRU: 5.00%
Second chance: 5.00%
En. second chance: 5.00%

With memory size of 100, the size of memory exceeds (or is equal to), the number of pages we are expected to handle.
Thus, the only faults are the 100 "cold start" faults
