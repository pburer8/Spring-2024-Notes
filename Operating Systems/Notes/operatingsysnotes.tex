\section{Introduction to OS}
What is an operating system?

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. (Wikipedia)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Definition has changed over years
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Originally, very bare bones
        \item Evolved to include more
    \end{itemize}
    \item Operating System (OS)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Interface between the user and the architecture
        \item Implements a virtual machine that is easier to program than raw hardware
    \end{itemize}
    \item Middleware between user programs and system hardware
    \item Manages hardware: CPU, main memory, I/O devices
\end{itemize}
OS: Traditional View:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interface between user and architecture
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hides architectural details
    \end{itemize}
    \item Implements Virtual machine:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Easier to program
    \end{itemize}
    \item Illusionist
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Bigger, faster, reliable
    \end{itemize}
    \item Government
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Divides resources
        \item "Taxes" = overhead
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
New Developments in OS:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Operating systems: active field of research
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Demands on OS's growing
        \item New application spaces (Web, Grid, Cloud)
        \item Rapidly evolving hardware
    \end{itemize}
    \item Open-source operating systems
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Linux etc.
        \item You can contribute to and develop OS's
        \item Excellent research platform
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
OS: Salient Features
\begin{itemize}
    \item Services: The OS provides standard services which the hardware implements
    \item Coordination: The OS coordinates multiple applications and users to achieve fairness and efficiency
    \item Design an OS so that the machine is convenient to use and efficient
\end{itemize}
Why study OS?
\begin{itemize}
    \item Abstraction: How to get the OS to give users an illusion of infinite resources
    \item System Design: How to make tradeoffs between performance, convenience, simplicity, and functionality
    \item Basic Understanding: The OS provides the services that allow application programs to work at all
    \item System Intersection Point: The OS is the point where hardware and software meet
\end{itemize}

Not many operating systems are under development, so you are unlikely to get a job building an OS. However, understanding operating systems will enable you to use your computer more efficiently \newline
Build Large Computer Systems
\begin{itemize}
    \item OS as an example of large system design
    \item Goals: 
\end{itemize}

\section{OS Structure and Architecture}

Modern OS Functionality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Concurrency
    \item I/O Devices
    \item Memory management
    \item Files
    \item Distributed systems and networks
\end{itemize}

OS Principles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item OS as juggler
    \item OS as government
    \item OS as complex system
    \item OS as history teacher
\end{itemize}

Protection:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kernel mode vs User Mode
    
    To protect the system from aberrant users, some instructions are restricted to use only by the OS

    Users may not
    \begin{itemize}
        \item address I/O directly
        \item use instructions that manipulate the state of memory
        \item set the mode bits that determine user or kernel mode
        \item disable and enable interrupts
        \item halt the machine
    \end{itemize}

    In kernel mode, the OS can do all of these things

    \item Hardware needs to support at least both kernel and user
\end{itemize}

Crossing Protection Boundaries:

System call: OS procedure that executes privileged instructions
\begin{itemize}
    \item Causes a trap
    \item The trap handler uses the parameter to jump
    \item The handler saves caller's state so it can restore control
    \item The architecture must permit this
\end{itemize}

Memory Protection:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Architecture must provide support to the OS to protect user programs and itself
    \item The simplest technique is to use base and limit registers
    \item Instantiated by the OS before starting a program
    \item The CPU checks user reference ensuring it falls between base and limit values
\end{itemize}
